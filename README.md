## Lessons Learned 
With this project I learned how to access and manipulate SQL databases with JDBC. This was my first time introducing other technologies into a Java project in order to access objects and information outside of the Java code itself. This presented new challenges and frustrations that I have not faced up until this point, but it really opened my eyes to the capabilities of the technologies used. I am excited to continue to use databases and build upon my skills as a developer with these newly learned skills and technologies that are at my fingertips.
